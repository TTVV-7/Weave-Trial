"""Build the case's toolpath, layer by layer, with a colour on every run.

Each layer is a distance field (see :mod:`phonecase.shapes`), each perimeter
is a contour of it, and the solid back plate is contours plus rectilinear
infill. Then every run is cut into colour runs against the paint plan and the
layer is reordered so each filament is used once and once only. That
reordering is worth more than it looks: a tool change on an AMS costs a purge
of roughly a gram, so a layer that changes colour six times instead of three
doubles the waste and the print time.

Two choices that are not the obvious ones:

* Wall perimeters are spaced ``wall / perimeters`` rather than one line width
  apart, so whatever wall thickness you ask for is filled exactly -- no void
  up the middle of a 1.7 mm wall, no over-packed wall that bows out.
* Only the outermost perimeter is painted on the sides, and only the first
  ``art_layers`` of the back plate are painted at all. Everything under the
  skin is the body colour, because nobody can see it and every colour change
  down there is another gram in the purge bin.
